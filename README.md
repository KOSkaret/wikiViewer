## User stories

The criteria for this project is being able to fetch multiple data entries from wikipedias pages, from a search query that the user defines in a text input. The query should return multiple results and displayed on the page it self.

The second criteria for this project, is being able to open a wikipedia article, which are chosen at random, by pressing a button on the page itself.


## TODO

- When fetching results from wikipedia and insert, make it so that they are transitioned in.
- Prevent search if there is no value in text field.
- Add an error for the api query.
